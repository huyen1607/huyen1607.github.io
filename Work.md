#### WORK EXPERIENCE
**SmallMachines Inc / Corporation R&D Center**<br>
*Software Team, Researcher, and Software Engineer*<br>
*01-2023 - Present*

[SmallMachines](https://www.smallmachines.co.kr/default/) is my first company after college graduation. Here, I have an opportunity to work with many passionate and talented engineers. We're all working towards building an universial personalized healthcare system. My tasks focus on AI in Healthcare.

**Research in progress:** <br>
A Multimodal System for the Early Prediction of Sepsis and Septic Shock using Complete Blood Count data, Vital Signs and Clinical Notes Extraction *(expected manuscript completion: January 2024)* <br>

**TASKS DESCRIPTION:** <br>
- Develop a model that classifies patients suspected of having sepsis infection. Input parameters include 30 routines from the Complete Blood Count (CBC) test (e.g: WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin,...). Data is preprocessed by cleaning, EDA, visualization, imputation, transformation, removing highly correlated variables. Apply supervised machine learning to preprocessed data, current Accuracy and AUC scores are 0.92, 0.95 (LightGBM), respectively. 
- Develop a model to predict progression to septic shock in patients with high probability of having sepsis. Input parameters include 30 routines from the CBC test, along with time-series vital signs data (blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse, body temperature) and clinical notes. Vital signs data is preprocessed by imputation, extracting clinical notes (text data) & converting into vector representation using TF-IDF. Apply supervised machine learning to preprocessed data, current Accuracy and AUC scores are 0.65, 0.6 (ExtratreesClassifier), respectively. 
- Take part in building a machine learning model for early detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in elderly people, using p-tau, t-tau, Aβ42, Aβ40 measured by company's immunoassay analyzer. Current accuracy is 0.72, more experiments and features selection work need conducting.
- Develop web-based platforms using React JS, Flask, Firebase, and Google Cloud to deploy the trained Machine Learning models, making the models accessible. 
- Join building a mobile app which gets real-time ECG data from a measured device and suggests music for users based on stress level calculated from Heart Rate Variability metrics.
- Conduct preliminary research for R&D projects funded by the Korean Government by reviewing research papers to analyze multiple approaches' viability (example: Relationship between vitamin D and Breast Cancer, Biomarkers in detecting myocardial infarction).
